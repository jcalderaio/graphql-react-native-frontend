## Directions

1) clone repo
2) change directories into folder and run “npm install”
3) run “react-native run-ios" or "react-native run-android"

*Note: Some Android emulators do not run on the same localhost as the server, meaning the database would not work. Please be aware of this. The ios emulator works better for testing.
